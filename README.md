# MLOps Pipeline for Real-Time Fraud Detection

> A full-stack, enterprise-grade MLOps system powered by Firebase, Next.js, and Gemini CLI — designed to detect and adapt to fraudulent activity at scale.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a production-ready MLOps pipeline for real-time fraud detection, combining cloud-native infrastructure, automated retraining, and CI/CD deployment. Built on Google Firebase and Gemini CLI, the system processes live transactions, flags anomalies, and adapts through statistical drift detection and triggered model updates.

Whether used for prototyping or scaling into high-traffic production systems, this architecture showcases how to deliver trusted, explainable AI with minimal operational overhead.
