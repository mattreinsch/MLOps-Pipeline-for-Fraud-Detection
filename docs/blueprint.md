# **App Name**: MLOps Observatory

## Core Features:

- Pipeline Visualization: Show the progression of the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, displaying current status and past durations.
- System Metrics Dashboard: Display key performance indicators of system operations (like uptime and latency).
- Model Performance Metrics: Display key model performance metrics (like F1 score and AUC).
- AI-Powered Feature Analysis: Use a generative AI model to assess feature importance of incoming transaction data and highlight potentially problematic feature values.
- AI-Driven Drift Assessment: Assess the risk associated with data drift; provide feedback/explanations as to which features contribute to the overall drift.
- Real-time Fraud Detection Display: Display sample transactions and their risk scores, indicating which ones have been flagged as potentially fraudulent.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#6366F1) to establish trust and convey technological innovation.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#334155) to provide contrast and a modern feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#14B8A6) to highlight interactive elements and key metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and easily readable interface.
- Use a consistent set of icons from Lucide to represent various pipeline stages and metrics.
- Employ a grid-based layout to maintain balance, with the option to highlight more crucial info with progressively scaled text.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when the ML pipeline proceeds from one stage to the next.
